# 5402-ENLP-Indian-NER
Group 5's final project for COSC 5402 ENLP

# Paper
(Kalamkar et al. 2022) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03442 created a corpus of 16,570 Indian court sentences and preambles and trained a Roberta-based transformer Named Entity Recognizer to emit spans for 14 entity types (COURT, PETITIONER, STATUTE, JUDGE, ‚Ä¶). Their data and models are available on the GitHub and Hugging Face websites.

# Unannotated US legal opinions
* https://static.case.law/
* opinions.sample.csv is a small subset, as is the .spacy file
* Originals are very large (~50GB compressed). Takes 2.5 hours to decompress entirely, producing a 259GB file with many opinions.
* Note that legal opinions are in the public domain and therefore **not** [subject to copyright](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1150_7m58.pdf)

# Baseline Model
Due to size issues with GitHub, our models can be found at https://github.com/peterngng/AI_NER-main

# üì¶ Testing the Baseline Model

## 1. Install the pre-trained baseline model

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
pip install https://huggingface.co/opennyaiorg/en_legal_ner_trf/resolve/main/en_legal_ner_trf-3.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## 2. Run the baseline model

```bash
python run_legal_ner.py
```

This script will run the baseline model and display the output in your browser for easy visualization of the extracted entities.

# üõ† Using the Designed Model

Our designed model is located in the `training` folder and includes the best-trained configuration for improved performance.

## Components

- `best_model`: The best-trained version of the custom model.
- `train2.py`: Script to train the model using provided datasets.
- `pred.py`: Script to predict legal entities from documents.
- `evaluate2.py`: Script to evaluate the model and calculate performance metrics.
- `check.py` and `check_label.py`: Scripts to ensure data integrity and validate dataset labels.

---

# üöÄ Steps to Use the Designed Model

## 1. Train the Model

Use `train2.py` to train the model with your dataset:

```bash
python ./training/train2.py
```

## 2. Make Predictions

Use `pred.py` to predict legal entities on new documents:

```bash
python ./training/pred.py
```

## 3. Evaluate the Model

Run `evaluate2.py` to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics:

```bash
python ./training/evaluate2.py
```

## 4. Check Data Integrity

Use `check.py` and `check_label.py` to verify the integrity of your dataset:

```bash
python ./training/check.py
python ./training/check_label.py
```
